A simple app that communicates with a LEGO Mindstorm EV3 via Bluetooth.

You can let your LEGO Mindstorm EV3 scan a 2D map built on some specifics explained by the "Map Rules" section. Once correctly scanned the virtual map based on the physical one will be saved an can be accessed or deleted.

You can access one of the saved maps and let your Mindstorm do simple tasks as adding, removing or moving some objects on the physical map just by interacting with the virtual one.

You can also move the robot manually by yourself.

In the Rules section of the app you can come across a guide on how the LEGO Mindstorm os built.

Note: Sometimes the light sensor could not work properly and could not be able to recognize the right color. It is up to you to find the best illumination and the best color gradients to work with.

Note: This App is a University assignment project made with a group of people. Its interface is presented in Italian language.
